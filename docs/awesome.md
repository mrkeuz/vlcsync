# Awesome possible use cases

## **3D cinema**   
  Shot to multiple/3d cameras -> play on curve screen, like in [this video](https://youtu.be/PLd-00W2HEg)

## Sync video in rooms   
with bi-directional control

## Sync with external audiofile
Well, I donâ€™t know a football match with different commentators

## Backlight for movie via ext monitor/device
i.e. film cam proceess via some transform filters

## Watching films with different languages together

You have to set up multiple audio outputs first for two different headphones, then start the same video twice. On one instance the audio track and device is language1, and on the second it is language2 and vlcsyn synchronizes it perfectly. This way we can watch the same series with our preferred language and still watch it together :)
Thanks @fafan999 for idea ðŸš€
